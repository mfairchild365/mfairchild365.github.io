title: About Me
---

Hello everyone. I'm a web developer. Some might call me a 'full stack' web developer, otherwise might call me a back-end programmer. I call myself a web applications developer. I am a jack of all trades, but a master of none. I do think that I have more experience in backend development than frontend. I also know that my weakness is frontend development. The moment someone starts talking about fonts or brand colors, I start to zone out. I tend to focus more on the programmatic side of things than the aesthetics. The doesn't mean that I think aesthetics are less valuable, I just don't have an eye for them. And that is absolutely fine.

I think it will be worthwhile to list some of my experience as a developer to help you get a better understanding of what I know.
