title: About Me
---

Hello everyone. I'm a web developer. Some might call me a 'full stack' web developer, others might call me a back-end programmer. I call myself a web applications developer. I am a jack of all trades, but a master of none. I enjoy user experience and inclusive design, but visual design is something I do not have a talent in. My passion is web accessibility, and I'm a [Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA) from IAAP](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpwacertification).

## What I know

I think it will be worthwhile to list some of my experience as a developer to help you get a better understanding of what I know.

### Most knowledgeable in

* LAMP Stack
* JavaScript
* NodeJS
* **accessibility and inclusive design** (this is a focus of mine)
