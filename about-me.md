title: About Me
---

Hello everyone. I'm a web developer. Some might call me a 'full stack' web developer, otherwise might call me a back-end programmer. I call myself a web applications developer. I am a jack of all trades, but a master of none. I do think that I have more experience in backend development than frontend. I also know that my weakness is frontend development. The moment someone starts talking about fonts or brand colors, I start to zone out. I tend to focus more on the programmatic side of things than the aesthetics. The doesn't mean that I think aesthetics are less valuable, I just don't have an eye for them. And that is absolutely fine.

## What I know

I think it will be worthwhile to list some of my experience as a developer to help you get a better understanding of what I know.

### Most knowledgeable in

* PHP
* MySQL
* Apache
* **accessibility and inclusive design** (this is a focus of mine)

### knowledgeable in

* Higher education (I work for em!)
* Enterprise system development
* Public speaking (also my greatest fear)
* Drupal, Zend, Symfony, propel, twig (php frameworks and libraries)
* JavScript (including nodejs)
* Leading (leading development, leading people)

### Least knowledgeable in

* Spelling

### Interests in

* Criminal Justice (I'm studying it!)
* English (reading and writing are fun!)
* Gaming (tabletop, video, you name it)
* DIY projects (from raspberry pi to plumbing and remodeling)
* Always learning and never assuming that I know more than anyone else


## Some projects that I have worked on

I think it is important to list some of the projects that I have worked on in order to help paint the picture of who I am as a developer.

### SiteMaster

[SiteMaster](https://github.com/UNLSiteMaster/site_master) is an auditing platform built in PHP, MySQL, and nodejs via a headless browser. While it is an open source project, [it is deployed at UNL](https://webaudit.unl.edu) and does link checking, HTML validation, Accessibility checking, and Governance checking on over 1,000 websites. This project was deployed in 2014 and is still in production.

### UNLchat

UNLchat is an online visitor chat system that supports both email conversations and chat. It is deployed on thousands of pages. This was my first major project as a developer, mostly built in my time as a student worker. It has served us well since 2012, and deserves a solid redesign to support the latest industry standards. Hopefully soon!

### Passel 2.0

One of my first projects was to maintain an existing web application, passel. This is an eLibrary, housing lessons, animations, quizzes and even moodle courses and is used internally. In 2016, I had the opportunity to make a new version of the outdated system, which will hopefully be put into production in 2017.

### MediaHub

[MediaHub](https://mediahub.unl.edu/) is another project that I have had a hand in. The application hosts both video and audio used on UNL websites so that the content is available regardless of where the user is located (there are several counties that block youtube for example). The system also sports captioning for $1/min and searchable transcripts.


## My Education

This might come as a little bit of a surprise. I have an Associates Degree in Computer Information Technology (web programming) from South East Community College (SCC) in Lincoln Nebraska. I don't want to belittle that degree, because I'm a firm believer that community college is an vital part of education and is vastly undervalued when it comes to computer sciences. My educational career in higher education began with me attending UNL in 2008 and quickly running out of money to finish my education. I transferred SCC, got my associates, and am now continuing my education at UNL in Criminal Justice (while also working there full time). Why Criminal Justice? Because it is an important part of our society, and I want to learn more about it. Do I need a better reason? No.
