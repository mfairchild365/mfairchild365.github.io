<h1>Focus management problems (active element is removed before redirecting focus) - hacky fixes and theories</h1>


<p>Instructions: using a screen reader, navigate to the button in each example and activate it. It will be replaced with a message. Is that message announced when it is focused?</p>

<h2>Example 1: theory: change the DOM enough so that the browser doesn't recover to the element that is getting focus</h2>
<div>
<button id="example1">Load</button>
</div>

<h2>Example 2: set focus after element loads</h2>
<div>
<button id="example2">Load</button>
</div>

<h2>Example 3: force reset focus (send to sr-only div and then back)</h2>
<div>
<button id="example3">Load</button>
</div>

<h2>Example 4: force reset focus (send to sr-only div and then back) - after a slight delay</h2>
<div>
<button id="example4">Load</button>
</div>

<h2>Example 5: visually hide the trigger, then send focus to the new content, then remove the trigger</h2>
<div>
<button id="example5">Load</button>
</div>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Example 4 was the only one that consistently passed.</li>
  <li>It seems that the the delay is needed so that everything in the a11y stack has a chance to catch up and notice what is changing.</li>
  <li>The fact that a delay is needed makes this fragile. How much of a delay is needed? Do we need a longer delay on slower machines?</li>
  <li>In theory, it could be possible to make example 4 a function. For example when you call focusWithDelay('#target', callback), the function could inject the 'please wait' sr-only div, send focus to it, perform the callback (remove and replace content), then send focus to the desired selector, then remove the 'please wait' sr-only div, all while handling appropriate delays.</li>
